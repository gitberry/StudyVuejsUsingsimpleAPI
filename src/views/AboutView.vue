    <p>This is a simple demonstration of a "web brochure".  
      In this example, each stop in the trail has it's own url (ie /Stop01 , /Stop02 etc)
      and corresponding page with information about that particular
      stop in the trail.  
    </p>    
    <p>
      If you have suggestions for another trail or activity, 
      or would like to make your own you can use the example
      on github (url to go here) or reach out to the author
      to consult on possibilities.
