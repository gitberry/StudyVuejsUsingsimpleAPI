This is a continuation of a study.  I took a simple app I'd built in HTML:
https://github.com/gitberry/StudyMobileFirst-1-HTMLPlain

and refactored it as a vuejs SPA:
https://github.com/gitberry/VuejsRoutingIISSubDirExample
It showed off routes and also had a nice side lesson on how to implement a vuejs on IIS subfolders

All the data was within the app however so I refactored it to use a simple JSON API

Next: the simple JSON backend API I build for this written in .net 4.7 for IIS...
